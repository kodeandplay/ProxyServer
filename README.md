        The following program is a proxy server written using nodejs.
There were several (outdated) tutorials/videos online that set a
foundation but that the fact that they were so old and nodejs is a
neverending evolving beast, they just didn't work.  So after putting
together what the tutorials/videos mentioned in addition to the
documentation provided directly from the nodejs website, we have my
working interpretation.
